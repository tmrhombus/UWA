We have presented a measurement of the $\Wbb$ production
cross section in proton-proton collisions at 8\TeV. The $\PW+\bbbar$ events
have been  selected in the $\PW \to \ell\nu$ decay mode with a
lepton of $\pt>30\GeV$ and $|\eta|<2.1$, and two b jets with $\pt>25\GeV$ and $|\eta|<2.4$.
The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of $19.8\fbinv$.
%is consistent with the SM prediction.
The measured cross section ***QUOTE RESULTS***
%$\sigma(pp\rightarrow \mathrm{W} + \bbbar, p_T^{\mathrm{b}}>25~\GeV, |\eta^{\mathrm{b}}|<2.4)\times {\cal{B}}(\Wmn, p_T^{\mu}>25~\GeV, |\eta^{\mu}|<2.1) =0.53\pm  0.05\stat \pm 0.09 \syst \pm 0.06 \theo \pm 0.01\lumi \unit{pb}$
for production of a $\PW$ boson in association with two b jets is in agreement with
the SM predictions.
This study provides the first measurement in this particular phase-space at 8\TeV,
therefore complementing previous measurements performed at the LHC ~\cite{Aad:2011kp}.
This result is approaching the precision of theoretical predictions at NNLO,
thus setting the grounds for sensitive tests of perturbative calculations in the SM.

In addition to this measurement of the cross section, we have explored the kinematics of the $\Wbb$ system.
The observed distributions are well described by the simulation.
