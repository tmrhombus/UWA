\section{Systematics}\label{Syst}

Major sources of systematic uncertainties are described in this section. 
Their contribution to the total uncertainty is presented in Table \ref{tab:NuisanceTable}. 


\begin{itemize}
\item One of the dominant uncertainties comes from the background normalization. 
The initial yields of the background contributions are normalized wherever possible to the 
corresponding cross sections as measured by CMS or to the NNLO predictions as listed in 
Table~\ref{tab:MCSAMPLES}. 
\item The uncertainties on the b-tagging are taken from Ref.~\cite{BTAGNOTE} and affect different 
MC samples in different ways as presented in Table~\ref{tab:NuisanceTable}. 
\item The Jet Energy Scale is allowed to vary up and down by one standard deviation, with values taken from the Jet Database \cite{}.
This variance is added to the fit as a binned shape variation in a 2 dimensional fit.
\item Muon Energy Scale: The Muon Energy Scale is allowed to vary up and down by $\pm 1 \%$ as recommended by the Muon POG. This variance is added to the fit as a binned shape variation in the 2 dimensional fit.
%\item Pile-up multiplicity: The number of pile-up interactions from the monte carlo has been re-weighted to reproduce better the conditions of data. The uncertainty associated to this can be estimated by shifting the overall mean of the number of vertices up or down $\pm$ 0.6, to cover the uncertainties due to pile-up modeling
\item Unclustered Energy: To account for $\MET$ uncertainty the component of $\MET$ that is not clustered in jets is scaled by $\pm10\%$ and added to the fit as a binned shape variation.
%\item The uncertainties due to trigger simulation, 1\%, and due to lepton reconstruction, identification and isoltion, 2\% are also considered.
\item The luminosity uncertainty, 2.6\% is taken from Ref.~\cite{LUMI}
\item The QCD uncertainty in the 
final fit is taken to be $\pm50\%$; this uncertainty comes directly from the uncertainty on the
fit in the QCD background-enriched control region.
